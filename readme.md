Here's next week's homework:

Very similar to last week
- Accept a filename and an employee serial number as command line input
- Read list of employees from a JSON formatted file
- Print out employee information using a "Show" method on a struct type

Data input example:
[
{ “name”:”Ann”,
“serial”:”123456”,
“age”:22,
“address”:”123 Main Street”
},
{ “name”:”Bob”,
“serial”:”847622”,
“age”:34,
“address”:”3901 South Miami Blvd”
}
]
